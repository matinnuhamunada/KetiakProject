Metagenomic Analysis of Human Axillary Skin Microbiome in Tropical Climate 

## Project Description
The objective of this research is to profile the axillary skin (armpits) microbiome of a healthy person living in tropical climate using metagenomic approach. The research is limited as case study to people aged 15-45 living in Yogyakarta. An ethical clearance will be submitted for approval prior the commencement of the research. Swab samples will be collected from the armpits of volunteers by paramedics. The sample will be preserved in RNALater and transported to the laboratory for analysis. Sample DNA will be extracted to prepare 16S rRNA library using 6FAM-labelled forward primer and Yakima Yellow-labelled reverse primers, 8F (FAM-5’-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3’) and 907R (5’-CCG TCA ATT CMT TTG AGT TT-3’). Purified Amplicons then digested using selected Restriction Enzymes, purified, and sent for capillary electrophoresis using AB3130 genetic analyser. Further identification of 16S rRNA samples will be done using Sanger Sequencing to allow precise assignments of bacterial taxa. The profile of axillary skin microbiome will be used to gain insight of the relationship between host-microbiome interaction with resistance to tropical disease and body odour. We will compare the result with currently available database of human skin microbiome in the sub-tropical area.
