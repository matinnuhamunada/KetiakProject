    "## Abstract\n",
    "Human skin microbiome is unique to individuals in regards to many aspects, including behaviour, environment, and perhaps maybe genes. To understand more about the distribution of human skin microbiome across the globe, we compare several skin microbiome study available in the EBI-Metagenomic Portal. Study data was acquired using EBI-Metagenome API, and sample data was selected based on sex, location, and bodysite. The biological observation matrix from the analysis result of the selected samples were compared using MEGAN. \n",

      "Study abstract: 16S rRNA gene sequences amplified from subjects with eczema and age-matched healthy controls.  Microbes living in and on humans are ten times more numerous than human cells. Culture-based methods have been the primary techniques used to study microbes inhabiting humans; however, many species are not successfully grown in culture. The NIH Roadmap for Medical Research Human Microbiome Project (HMP) aims to investigate the microbes in the gastrointestinal tract, oral cavity, skin, vagina, and nares. The goal of the HMP is to comprehensively characterize the human microbiota and analyze its role in human health and disease.   The skin serves not only as a barrier against invading pathogens and moisture loss, but also as a host to microbial communities. The skin of an adult is an approximately 2 square meter surface with a myriad of microenvironments.  Atopic dermatitis (AD), more commonly known as eczema, is a common skin disorder that is exacerbated by Staphylococcus aureus colonization.  This study aims to investigate the skin microbiota of AD patients at specific timepoints (quiescence, disease flares, and post-treatment) to examine how disease state correlates with changes in the skin microflora.     The 16S small subunit ribosomal (rRNA) gene is present in every bacterial cell, serving as a universal marker. The gene is sufficiently conserved to allow accurate alignment but adequately varied to enable phylogenetic analyses. Sequencing via 16S rRNA-based phylotyping has been used to survey the bacterial microbes on the skin.  Initially, we will examine the bacterial diversity associated with AD using a 16S rRNA survey and later broadening to include fungi, viruses, archaea and mites. In addition, bacteria will be cultured on a wide variety of media and isolates representing both abundant and novel species will be selected for whole genome sequencing.  To characterize fungal diversity, we utilize two phylogenetic markers within the rDNA region: 18S rRNA and the Intervening Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region.  Full microbial diversity will be explored with shotgun metagenomic sequencing.\n",

      "Study abstract: Microgravity induces physiological deconditioning due to the absence of gravity loading, resulting in bone mineral density loss, atrophy of lower limb skeletal and postural muscles, and lengthening of the spine. SkinSuit is a lightweight compression suit designed to provide head-to-foot (axial) loading to counteract spinal elongation during spaceflight. As synthetic garments may impact negatively on the skin microbiome, we used 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon procedures to define bacterial skin communities at sebaceous and moist body sites of five healthy male volunteers undergoing SkinSuit evaluation. Each volunteer displayed a diverse, distinct bacterial population at each skin site. Short (8 h) periods of dry hyper-buoyancy flotation wearing either gym kit or SkinSuit elicited changes in the composition of the skin microbiota at the genus level but had little or no impact on community structure at the phylum level or the richness and diversity of the bacterial population. We also determined the composition of the skin microbiota of an astronaut during pre-flight training, during an eight-day visit to the International Space Station involving two 8 h periods of SkinSuit wear, and for one month after return. Changes in composition of bacterial skin communities at five body sites were strongly linked to changes in geographical location. A distinct ISS microbiome signature was found which reversed to a pre-flight profile on return. No changes in microbiome complexity or diversity were noted, with little evidence for colonisation by potentially pathogenic bacteria. We conclude that short periods of SkinSuit wear do not compromise the healthy skin microbiome.\n",

      "Study name: Longitudinal study of the diabetic skin and wound microbiome\n",
      "Study abstract: Background: Type II diabetes is a chronic health condition which is associated with skin conditions including chronic foot ulcers and an increased incidence of skin infections.  The skin microbiome is thought to play important roles in skin defence and immune functioning.  Diabetes affects the skin environment, and this may perturb skin microbiome with possible implications for skin infections and wound healing.  This study examines the skin and wound microbiome in type II diabetes. Results: Ten type II diabetic subjects with chronic foot ulcers were followed over a time course of 10 weeks, sampling from both foot skin (swabs) and wounds (swabs and debrided tissue) every two weeks. A control group of 8 non-diabetic subjects was also followed over 10 weeks, and skin swabs collected from the foot skin every two weeks.  The diabetic skin microbiome was significantly less diverse than non-diabetic skin.  Community composition was also significantly different between diabetic and non-diabetic skin, however the most abundant taxa were similar between groups, with differences driven by very low abundant members of the skin communities. Chronic wounds were generally colonized by the most dominant skin Staphylococcus, along with other taxa that generally different by patient. No significant correlations were found between wound duration or healing status and the abundance of any particular taxa, while wound size was positively correlated with the dominant skin Staphylococcus.   Conclusions: The major difference observed in this study of the skin microbiome associated with diabetes was a significant reduction in diversity.  The long-term effects of reduced diversity are not yet well understood, but are often associated with disease conditions.\n",

      "Study name: Microbiome samples derived from Buruli ulcer wounds and non-Buruli ulcer skin ulcerations\n",
      "Study abstract: Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans and considered the third most prevalent mycobacterial disease in humans. This skin disease can affect the entire body surface, but primarily the lower extremities, with symptoms varying from nodules to ulcers. Secondary bacterial infections in open BU lesions are the main cause of pain, delayed healing and systemic illness, resulting in prolonged hospital stay. Thus understanding the diversity of bacteria in these open lesions is important for proper treatment. The normal skin flora is known to protect the host through commensal relationships, however, certain factors such as ulceration can shift the skin flora from being primarily commensal to potentially pathogenic. Therefore, the objective of this study was to characterize and compare the skin bacteria from BU ulcers, non-BU ulcers, and similar locations on the skin of healthy individuals. Results: Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we determined the microbial composition of 5 BU lesions, 3 non-BU lesions and 3 healthy skin samples, and compared these using a data analysis pipeline. Our results showed a lower bacterial diversity in both the BU and non-BU lesions compared to the healthy skin. However, no significant differences were found between BU and non-BU lesions. The BU lesions were characterized by an increase of Bacteroidetes compared to the non-BU wounds, which contained more (Gamma)Proteobacteria. Furthermore, the BU lesions also contained significantly more obligate anaerobes. All lesions contained a mixture of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with more gram-negatives present in the BU and non-BU lesions than in healthy skin samples. With this molecular-based study, we were also able to detect bacteria, which were missed by culture-based methods in previous BU studies.Conclusions: Our study suggests that BU leads to changes in the bacterial community within the lesions. These changes are potentially detrimental and may cause a delay in the healing process. In order to determine if the alterations in Bacteroidetes were due to a specific wound environment, underlying pathophysiological conditions created by M. ulcerans, or associated with wound location on the body, further microbiome studies are necessary.\n",

We hypothesized that the skin microbiome influences susceptibility to H. ducreyi infection and that infection with H. ducreyi causes changes in the skin microbiome. To address these hypotheses, we collected skin swab samples prior to inoculation with H. ducreyi, at Days 1, 2 and 5 post-inoculation, at clinical endpoint, and at the test of cure visit. Samples from four dose-matched pairs of volunteers that either resolved the infection or formed pustules were subjected to barcoded amplification and pyrosequencing of the V1-V3 region of bacterial 16S rRNA genes. We compared alpha and beta diversity measurements of the microbiomes of resolvers and pustule formers, and determined signature bacteria that were associated with infection resolution or pustule formation.\n",
